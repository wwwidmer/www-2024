This was mostly a quick learning project to get familiar with Nuxt and Vercel - and how is it strong. My estimate for building this was a day of planning and about six total hours of effecient coding. Some clever tools provided by Nuxt allow dynamics markdown loading, obvious routing mechanics, and a convention for serving assets without any additional custom configuration.",
