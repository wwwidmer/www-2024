## About

Hi! I am William (call me Billy) - I have ten years of professional experience as a software engineer. My talents have been used in many different industries and company sizes. I am currently on the search for new horizons and am trying to return to the startup world.

## This site

Vercel and Nuxtjs have been pretty trendy lately. I've worked with frameworks that abstracted away much of the boring parts of web development. I wanted to spin something up and time myself from concept to creation. So far I've put about six hours of work into this [site](/) - wow!
See the project [page](/projects/this-site) for more information
