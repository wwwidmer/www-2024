## About

Hi! I am William (call me Billy) - I have ten years of professional experience as a software engineer. My talents have been used in many different industries and company sizes. I am currently on the search for new horizons and am trying to return to the startup world. 

I love reading discourse on software philosophy, nerding out about obscure topics, and being heavily opinionated about how strange software development is. As of Summer 2024 I am taking a break from full time gigs but I'm usually online either helping out on [the trek](https://thetrek.co){target="\_blank"} or part time consulting. I am open to high level engineering roles.


## How I work

I am built on trust. Give out a project to a trusted colleague and assume the best intentions with everything. Give holistic advice but acknowledge everyone can do it their own way. Fix things when they break; The process should be blamed before a person. Create process for your teams strengths and weaknesses not the other way around. Pair work more often than not. It doesn't have to just be pair programming. My job is to resolve ambiguity and create a solution - not just code my way out.

Have fun, learn something obscure, built it without ego, destroy it, build it better, ad nauseam.

## This site

Vercel and Nuxtjs have been pretty trendy lately. I've I wanted to spin something up and time myself from concept to creation.orked with frameworks that abstracted away much of the boring parts of web development.
